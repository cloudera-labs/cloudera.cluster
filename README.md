# Ansible Collection for Cloudera Private Cloud

## Requirements

- Python 2.x or 3.x
- [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html)
- [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/)

**Do not use Ansible 2.9.0**. This version has an [issue with templating](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/64745) which causes the playbook execution to fail. Instead, use any 2.8.x version or a later 2.9.x version as these are not affected.

## Usage
This Ansible Collection is designed to work hand-in-hand with [Cloudera Deploy](https://github.com/cloudera-labs/cloudera-deploy), which contains reference Playbooks and Example Definitions.

## Tested Platforms

### Cloudera Distributions

- Cloudera Manager / CDP Private Cloud Base 7.1.x
- Cloudera Manager / CDP Private Cloud Base 7.0.3 (limited support)
- Cloudera Manager / CDH 6.x
- Cloudera Manager / CDH 5.x (limited support)

### Operating Systems

- Red Hat / CentOS 7.x
- Ubuntu 18.04.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver)

Active development is focused on **CDP Private Cloud Base** (formerly CDP-DC) deployments and their respective platform compatibility matrices.

> While these roles etc. can be used to deploy CDH 5.x and CDH 6.x environments, it is only possible to install a subset of their supported platform components (i.e JDK and database versions) using this tooling.
