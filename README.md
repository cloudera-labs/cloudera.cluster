# IMPORTANT NOTICE:

This feature branch includes support for:
- Upgrading Cloudera Manager Server and Cloudera Manager Agents
- Upgrading CDH 5 and/or CDH6 to CDP Private Cloud Base
- Refreshing the config for running clusters, including adding new services or updating the config of existing services.

These features are potentially very dangerous and can cause damage to running clusters if used incorrectly. If you plan to use these features, please ensure that you test thoroughly on a disposable environment, before running on clusters that are not disposable.

Cloudera recommends that Cloudera Professional Services be engaged before using these features, particularly as none of the automation products are not covered under your Cloudera Support agreements.

In order to use these capabilities you will need some permutation of the following variables:
- `cloudera_runtime_pre_upgrade` (specify the version of the legacy cluster - e.g. 5.16.2)
- `update_services` (true if you want to update the config of existing services)
- `upgrade_kts_cluster` (true to upgrade a kts cluster)
- `activate_runtime_upgrade` (true to do a patch release activation)
- `cdh_cdp_upgrade` (true to do a CDH to CDP upgrade)
- `upgrade_runtime` (true to upgrade between versions of CDH or CDP)

# Ansible Collection for Cloudera Private Cloud

## Requirements

- Python 2.x or 3.x
- [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html)
- [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/)

**Do not use Ansible 2.9.0**. This version has an [issue with templating](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/64745) which causes the playbook execution to fail. Instead, use any 2.8.x version or a later 2.9.x version as these are not affected.

## Usage
This Ansible Collection is designed to work hand-in-hand with [Cloudera Deploy](https://github.com/cloudera-labs/cloudera-deploy), which contains reference Playbooks and Example Definitions.

## Tested Platforms

### Cloudera Distributions

- Cloudera Manager / CDP Private Cloud Base 7.1.x
- Cloudera Manager / CDP Private Cloud Base 7.0.3 (limited support)
- Cloudera Manager / CDH 6.x
- Cloudera Manager / CDH 5.x (limited support)

### Operating Systems

- Red Hat / CentOS 7.x
- Ubuntu 18.04.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver)

Active development is focused on **CDP Private Cloud Base** (formerly CDP-DC) deployments and their respective platform compatibility matrices.

> While these roles etc. can be used to deploy CDH 5.x and CDH 6.x environments, it is only possible to install a subset of their supported platform components (i.e JDK and database versions) using this tooling.
