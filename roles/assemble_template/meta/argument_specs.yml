    short_description: "Discover and render files into a cluster template"
    description:
      - Discovers fragment files in a specified directory, loops through fragment files rendering them through M(ansible.builtin.template), places them in a temporary directory, and then assembles a single, final cluster template.
      - Fragment files must be located on the Ansible controller since M(ansible.builtin.template) only executes on the controller.
      - This ensures that the template processing occurs on the Ansible controller machine.
